# Enhancing Blockchain Scalability through Sharding and Layer-2 Solutions

This is a placeholder PDF for the blockchain scalability research paper.

## Abstract

This research addresses the critical scalability limitations of current blockchain networks by proposing a novel hybrid architecture that combines database sharding with optimistic rollups. Our experimental results demonstrate a 1000x improvement in transaction throughput while maintaining security guarantees.
