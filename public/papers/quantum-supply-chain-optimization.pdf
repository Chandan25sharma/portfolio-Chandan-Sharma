# Quantum Algorithms for Optimization Problems in Supply Chain Management

This is a placeholder PDF for the quantum algorithms research paper.

## Abstract

We present quantum algorithms specifically designed for solving NP-hard optimization problems commonly found in supply chain management. Our quantum annealing approach shows exponential speedup over classical methods for certain problem instances, with practical implications for logistics and inventory management.
