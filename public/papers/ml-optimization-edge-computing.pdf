## Abstract

This paper presents novel techniques for optimizing machine learning models specifically for edge computing environments. We propose a hybrid approach combining model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation to achieve significant reductions in model size and computational requirements while maintaining accuracy.

## Introduction

Edge computing has become increasingly important...
